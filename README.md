# Full-adder
This project implements a 1-bit Full Adder using behavioral modeling in Verilog. It includes a testbench to verify functionality across all input combinations. Ideal for beginners exploring digital design and simulation.

Inputs: A, B, Cin — 1-bit each

Outputs: Sum, Cout — 1-bit each

Modeling Style: Behavioral

Function: Adds three 1-bit inputs and produces sum and carry
